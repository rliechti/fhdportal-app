# Teams

The {{country_adjective}} FEGA node is a consortium between multiple leading organisations in the {{country_adjective}} research landscape, supported by [SERI](https://www.sbfi.admin.ch/sbfi/en/home.html) through the [SPHN](https://sphn.ch/) funding scheme and the [BioMedIT](https://www.biomedit.ch/) project.

We come together to participate in the [FEGA network](https://ega-archive.org/about/projects-and-funders/federated-ega/), and provide a safe location for {{country_adjective}} research data.

The leading house for the Swiss FEGA node is [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/) - which is a national non-profit organisation dedicated to biological and biomedical data science, and the [Swiss ELIXIR node](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/switzerland). 

SIB is the organisation which will join the FEGA network, and represents a larger consortium which will contribute to the node. The current partners and their role are the following:

*   [ETH NEXUS Personalized Health Technologies](https://www.nexus.ethz.ch/)  will collect and provide feedback on usability and user experience of data submitters and requesters.
*   [ETH Scientific IT Services](https://sis.id.ethz.ch/) will deploy the FEGA software and act as the service provider.
*   [Health 2030 Genome Center](https://www.health2030genome.ch/) will provide expert scientific support and community engagement.
*   [SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/) will manage agreements with users and the FEGA network as well as provide project management and legal support, acting as the service owner.
*   [Swiss Data Science Center](https://www.datascience.ch/) will provide key tools for managing access to data.
*   [Switch](https://www.switch.ch/) will provide a secure cloud environment as the infrastructure provider.

The Swiss FEGA project is being coordinated by Mark Ibberson, Clara Roujeau and Owen Appleton at SIB, you can contact them [here](mailto:fega.coordination@sib.swiss).
