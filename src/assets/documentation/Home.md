## Welcome to the Swiss node of the Federated European Genome-phenome Archive (Federated EGA or FEGA), part of the [EGA ELIXIR core data resource](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/core-data-resources).

  

The vision of the [FEGA network](https://ega-archive.org/about/projects-and-funders/federated-ega/) is to become _“the primary global resource for discovery and access of sensitive human omics and associated data consented for secondary use, through a network of national human data repositories to accelerate disease research and improve human health”_.

  

Swiss FEGA aims to provide a secure environment to archive genomic and other human data generated by researchers in Switzerland, compliant with Swiss legal protections. For researchers, it should simplify archiving such data in order to support reproducibility of research and enable data reuse.

  

[ETH's NEXUS](https://www.nexus.ethz.ch/) Director Daniel Stekhoven, a Swiss FEGA project partner, says _"A secure and federated repository for biomedical research data is essential to ensuring reproducibility, reinforcing the rigour and transparency of scientific endeavors and publishing across Switzerland. The Swiss FEGA node is more than just a repository – it's a catalyst for improving scientific discovery by providing researchers with secure access to a wealth of standardised data, fostering innovation in biomedical research and efficiency in innovation delivery"_

  

The Swiss FEGA node is currently under construction. We intend to have a live service in 2025 and play an active role in the European-scale community on archiving of genomic and other federated human data, supported by [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/).
