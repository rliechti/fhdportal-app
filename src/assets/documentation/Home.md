## Welcome to the {{ country_adjective }} node of the Federated European Genome-phenome Archive (Federated EGA or FEGA), part of the [EGA ELIXIR core data resource](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms/data/core-data-resources).

  

The vision of the [FEGA network](https://ega-archive.org/about/projects-and-funders/federated-ega/) is to become _“the primary global resource for discovery and access of sensitive human omics and associated data consented for secondary use, through a network of national human data repositories to accelerate disease research and improve human health”_.

  

{{ country_adjective }} FEGA aims to provide a secure environment to archive genomic and other human data generated by researchers in {{ country_name }}, compliant with {{ country_adjective }} legal protections. For researchers, it should simplify archiving such data in order to support reproducibility of research and enable data reuse.

  

The {{country_adjective}} FEGA node is currently under construction. We intend to have a live service in 2025 and play an active role in the European-scale community on archiving of genomic and other federated human data, supported by [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/).
